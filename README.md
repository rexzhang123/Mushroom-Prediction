# Mushroom-Prediction

Welcome to the Mushroom-Prediction project repository. This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various machine learning models to predict mushroom edibility, aiming to contribute to the field of mycology and food safety.

## About The Project

Mushroom-Prediction uses a range of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its characteristics. Our implementation provides insights into the effectiveness of different models in classifying mushrooms accurately.

## Key Features

- **Multiple ML Models**: Includes various machine learning models and compares their performances.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides an in-depth analysis of feature importance and model accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements data cleaning and preprocessing suitable for mushroom classification tasks.
