# Mushroom-Prediction

Welcome to the Mushroom-Prediction project repository. This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various machine learning models to predict mushroom edibility, aiming to contribute to the field of mycology and food safety.

## About The Project

Mushroom-Prediction uses a range of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its characteristics. Our implementation provides insights into the effectiveness of different models in classifying mushrooms accurately.
